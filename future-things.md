# A list of things I will or will not add in the future.



### An in game tutorial

The game does have a tutorial, but it should be thrown in a BuildingID(0x0003).

### Animations

The code for it is there, just need to add the actual animations
### Music

Eventually

### Better terain generation

water chunks, etc

### UI polish

yes

### more settings

make rebinds save to localstorage

fix the save format being inefficient

fix performance, don't redraw the tiles on every frame when moving

texture loading is sus

fix multiblocks breaking the resource acceptors(beta)

make buildings with recipes keep their items on save

add pausing

fix the text of the alert box overflowing

make "i wonder what this button does" splash do something when you click it
probably rickroll you

rename ctxes

convert "extractor layer" to "overlaybuild layer"

building id is very cursed

conveyor item handling is bad
