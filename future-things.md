# A list of things I will or will not add in the future.


### GET RID OF ALERT

Spamming alert boxes is awful and needs to be phased out quickly so the player doesnt get so annoyed they leave.

### A tutorial

The game does have a tutorial, but it should be thrown in a BuildingID(0x0003).

### Animations

The code for it is there, just need to add the actual animations

### Tooltips for conveyor items

Not trivial. On the todo.

### Music

Eventually

### Glitchy conveyors

Will eventually add a few more conveyors(T and + shaped) and then fix this

### Water chunks

Will be made more useful

### UI polish

yes

### saving to localstorage

yes
