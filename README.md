A factory building style game. Currently in Alpha, meaning:

I'm working on the engine, the progression/items/recipes are just random and will become actually good in beta.

Now at Alpha 1.3.0. Definitely playable, might be a bit buggy.

There's no tutorial for now, see the [wiki](https://github.com/BalaM314/Untitled-Electron-Game/wiki) until then.
