untitled electron game

A factory building style game. Currently in Alpha, meaning:

I'm working on the engine, the progression/items/recipes are just random and will become actually good in beta.

No numbered version because I forgot to do it. Oops.



Roadmap:

[✅]Finish fixing extractors which I've been working on for a literal month

[]Add a few more items and recipes just for fun

[✅]Fix tooltips; why are those even broken again-

[✅]Overhaul worldgen; make it not trash

[]Add GUIs to some buildings

[]Make the world actually... saveable...
